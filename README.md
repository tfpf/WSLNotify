# What?
A collection of settings for (primarily) Bash and GVIM. These can be used on
GNU/Linux or WSL without making any changes whatsoever.

# Why?
I use both GNU/Linux and WSL frequently. Having identical dotfiles for both
means I don't have to spend time setting up my environments or keeping them in
sync.
